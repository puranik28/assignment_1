        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Krishna!</p>
        <p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences. Currently, I am persuing an after-degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>This is my last semester so I am excited for it to be over and jump into the real world of tech</p>
        <p>I work at Shoppers Drug Mart as a beauty expert so if I am not at home coding, I am usually at work.</p>
        <p>I have two little birds named Coco and Sunny.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>During my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities such as cooking, reading, and taking walks to explore new trails around Edmonton. </p>
        <p>Lately, I have been really into skincare. I have a 4 step-skincare routine every night before going to bed.</p>
        <p>This website helped me a lot in expanding my knowledge and understanding of skincare: <a href="https://info.eminenceorganics.com/skin-care-routine" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
